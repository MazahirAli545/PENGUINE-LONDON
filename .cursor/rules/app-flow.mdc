You are a senior React Native architect.

TASK:
Refactor the existing project structure to a scalable production-grade architecture.

RULES:
1. Separate screens into two top-level folders:
   - src/auth (before authentication)
   - src/app (after authentication)

2. Move ALL reusable UI into src/components:
   - Move FlightCard, HotelCard, CarLimousineCard into src/components/cards
   - Extract Quote card logic into a reusable QuoteCard component
   - Ensure no screen directly contains reusable UI logic

3. Remove all per-screen styles.ts files.
   - Create a centralized styling system under src/styles:
     - colors.ts
     - spacing.ts
     - typography.ts
     - layout.ts
     - components.ts
   - Replace inline and screen styles with imports from src/styles

4. Update all imports to use path alias @/
   - Example: import { FlightCard } from '@/components/cards'

5. Ensure navigation logic still works:
   - RootNavigator handles auth vs app flow
   - MainLayout only renders app screens

6. Clean barrel exports:
   - Update index.ts files so screens and components are easy to import

7. DO NOT break functionality.
   - Preserve UI behavior
   - Preserve props
   - Preserve visual layout

8. After refactor:
   - No duplicate styles
   - No screen-specific UI components
   - Clear separation of auth and app flows

Proceed step-by-step and refactor the codebase accordingly.
